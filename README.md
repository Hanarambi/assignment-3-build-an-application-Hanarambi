A sql 50 state application,  I more or less consentrated more on UI design than the code.  I still did  most everything that was asked.  mostly because I 
spent all my time trying to make a professional looking UI  learned some things on this one,  and yes all the forms are diffrent looking only because they were all experiments with 
different ui controls and some new frameworks i have been using.  the edit (add delete update) states form is a little sloppy i can get it to mostly work the way I want,  and my 
Search form could use a little work,  but it mostly funtions as intended.  I would actally like another week on this one to tweek some interface and back end stuff.
